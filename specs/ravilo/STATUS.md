# Ravilo — Status

Living record of where **Ravilo** work stands. The
[`requirements/README.md`](requirements/README.md) is the single source of truth for which Ravilo
phases exist and their done/planned status; this file tracks current focus and context.

Ravilo is a sibling product **inside the jellystructure repo** — an Android TV **and** browser (WASM,
canvas) streaming front-end built from one **Compose Multiplatform** codebase, talking only to the
jellystructure backend.

## Current focus

**Specs drafted; nothing implemented yet.** The full phase set R01–R17 is planned (see
[`requirements/README.md`](requirements/README.md)). Recommended start order:

1. **R01** `:shared` (DTOs + `TvApiClient`) → **R02** Compose-MP scaffolding (Android TV + web canvas,
   one shared focus screen).
2. **R03** device pairing auth + `/api/tv/**` → **R04** per-user config store.
3. Backend data **R05–R08**; client UI **R09** (design system/focus) then **R10–R15**; **R16** web
   config screen; **R17** web hardening.

## Foundational decisions locked (constitution)

- **Control plane = jellystructure only; data plane = Jellyfin directly.** The client "logs into" only
  jellystructure (pairing); video/images stream from Jellyfin via brokered, scoped tokens.
- **Compose Multiplatform, two targets:** Android TV (Media3) + Web/WASM **canvas** (browser video).
  Maximise sharing — screens/theme/components/focus/state live once in `:ravilo-ui`. The
  jellystructure "no Compose for Web" rule is scoped to the **admin** frontend; the two WASM bundles
  (admin DOM, Ravilo canvas) coexist.
- **DTOs defined once** in `:shared`; reused by backend + admin frontend + both Ravilo clients.
- **Config is server-owned, per Jellyfin user, synced** across all a user's devices.
- **The TV renders server-composed layout & server-pushed state**; **Ravilo never mutates the
  library** (only playback progress, played/unplayed, per-user settings). **Non-admin** Jellyfin users
  are allowed.

## Design reference

- Visual target: the prototype in `design/ravilo/` (`Ravilo TV.html`, `ravilo.css`) — Aurora/Midnight/
  Noir skins, jellyfish brand, hero/channel-rail/rows, movie+series detail with watched/resume, search.
- The per-user config surface is mocked in `design/app/ravilo-config.html` (drives R16).

## Open threads

- **Stream brokering details (R08):** confirm how the per-user Jellyfin token is obtained/refreshed
  server-side from the paired session, and direct-play-vs-HLS selection policy.
- **Pairing approval UX (R03/R15):** web-session approval vs phone-credentials form — pick the primary
  path.
- **Compose-MP web a11y (R17):** canvas accessibility is best-effort; validate against real ATs early.
